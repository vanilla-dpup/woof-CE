# woof - the Puppy builder

This is a fork of [woof-CE](https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE).

The goal is to build something similar to [DebianDog](https://debiandog.github.io/doglinux/), a highly [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)-compatible "live" distro with a layered file system, but with core features of [Puppy Linux](https://puppylinux.com), a distro that -
* Provides a lightweight desktop environment and a variety of applications, all built from source to minimize dependencies
* Provides a fully functional package manager, [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) and support for extra read-only layers (sfs_load)
* Supports non-persistent, fully persistent or "persistent-on-demand" sessions where the user can decide whether or not to save, and when
* Has just a drop or two of Puppy's secret sauce: all kinds of legacy cruft, technical debt and complex in-house solutions are gone, to reduce size, speed things up, increase compatibility with Debian, make updates safe and ensure the project's sustainability with very few developers

## Overview

This fork strips woof-CE down to the bare essentials:

* Only dpup ([Debian](https://www.debian.org/) or [Devuan](https://www.devuan.org/) based Puppy) is supported.
* Support for X.Org and tools that modify xorg.conf is gone. Only Wayland is supported.
* Support for plain ALSA and [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) is gone. Only [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) is supported.
* Support for ROX-Filer is gone, and the "source of truth" regarding file associations and default applications is xdg-utils. /usr/local/bin/default* are provided for backward compatibility with Puppy.
* Most of 0setup, 1download, 2createpackages and 3builddistro is reimplemented using [debootstrap](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap). Build times are much shorter than upstream's.
* PPM and support for .pet packages are gone: packages in the build come from rootfs-packages or rootfs-petbuilds (built from source).
* The only supported kind of kernel packages is the "huge" one, and fdrv is built by moving /usr/lib/firmware out of the main SFS.
* Support for aufs is gone. Only [overlay](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/overlayfs.html) is supported.
* ISO images are gone: the woof-CE build output is a bootable flash drive image and `isoboot` is gone.
* Support for PUPMODEs other than 5 (live), 12 (automatic persistency) and 13 (on-demand persistency) is gone.
* Support PUPMODE 13 with periodic saving is gone. The user can run `save2flash` to save now, or save at shutdown.
* The partition containing Puppy files can be specified only using `pupsfs=$UUID`.
* Support for SAVEMARK and SAVESPEC is gone. The partition containing the save file/folder can be specified only using `psave=$UUID`.
* Support for pimod and pwireless is gone.
* ntfs-3g is replaced with [ntfs3](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/ntfs3.html).
* Support for the devx SFS is gone. Development packages are installed inside a copy of the main SFS during the build, but don't make it into the build output.
* The Puppy way of doing things is replaced with the upstream distro way of doing things. For example, rc.country is gone, and so is the hack of exporting LANG in /etc/profile. Instead, one should use /etc/default/locale, /etc/locale.gen, locale-gen, etc'.
* Themes are gone. [Themes break applications](https://stopthemingmy.app/) and they're hard to maintain.
* coreutils, util-linux, etc' are not replaced with symlinks to busybox, because this breaks compatibility with the upstream distro.
* busybox init, /etc/inittab, plogin, autologin, etc' are replaced with a simple init implementation (see woof-code/rootfs-petbuilds/init).
* Legacy cruft is removed from the init script (/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit) and it's much faster. Daemons like udev and dbus are started using their init scripts.
* Some core Puppy scripts that override the upstream distro are moved to /usr/local/{,s}bin and PATH makes the shell prefer them. This makes package updates safe, because they no longer remove Puppy's hooks.

Other changes:

* All save files (including encrypted ones) use ext4, with or without journaling.
* Bootflash in upstream supports FAT32 and f2fs, using syslinux, extlinux or efilinux. This fork adds ext4 support.
* If possible, save files are created as [sparse files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file), to reduce writing to disk and retain usable free space in the partition.
* Copying of SFSs to RAM (`pfix=ram|copy`) happens later in the boot process and it's implemented differently. SFSs are cached and not copied to the ramdisk (see woof-code/rootfs-petbuilds/sfslock), leaving more usable ramdisk space, and the memory spent on SFSs is freed automatically (using OOM score adjustment) if needed. However, this also means that the boot partition remains mounted even when using `pfix=ram`. In addition, SFSs are prioritized and lower priority SFSs are not cached when cached SFSs occupy half of available RAM.
* EXTRASFSLIST is now managed automatically and SFSs don't need to be "queued" by the user for loading at boot time. Instead, the init script loads all SFSs under psubdir (if specified) and the partition root, under both the save partition or the boot partition. SFSs are sorted numerically before loading, so 2something.sfs is loaded before 10something.sfs. This allows loading of extra SFSs without persistency and allows the user to control the stacking order. The stacking order of the traditional *drv SFS is retained, for backward compatibility.
* The [Landlock](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html)-based sandbox that restricts file system access for applications running as spot is stricter and also prevents spot from reading or writing files under the save partition. The sandbox blocks access to /root even if permissions are 777, but without this new restriction, spot can access /initrd/mnt/dev_save/*save/upper/root instead, to bypass the sandbox. This breaks compatibility with Puppy, because spot can only run applications installed to / and can't run "portable" applications that reside on the save partition.

## Persistency Modes (PUPMODE)

* 5: no persistency ("live"); changes to the layered file system at / reside in RAM and a shutdown prompt offers the user to save them.
* 12: full persistency; changes are saved directly to a file system image ("save file") or a directory ("save folder") used as the upper, writable layer of the layered file system at /.
* 13: on-demand persistency; changes to the layered file system at / reside in RAM and can be saved to a file system image ("save file") or a directory ("save folder") using `save2flash` and during shutdown. PUPMODE 13 is activated when `pmedia=usbflash` or when the save partition is a removable drive and `pmedia` is unspecified or `pmedia=cd`.
* 128: used internally until changes in a live session are saved.

## Boot Codes

* `pfix=nocopy`: disables locking of loaded SFSs into RAM. By default, loaded SFSs are locked into RAM, limited to consume half of RAM and this memory is freed automatically when running out of memory.
* `pfix=ram`: disables persistency.
* `pmedia=cd`: enables search for a partition containing a save file or folder.
* `pmedia=usbflash`: activates PUPMODE 13 and restricts the search for Puppy SFSs and a save file or folder to USB devices.
* `pupsfs=UUID|label`: specifies the partition containing Puppy SFSs using its UUID or label, and disables search for this partition.
* `psave=UUID|label`: specifies the partition containing the save file or folder using its UUID or label, and disables search for this partition.
* `psubdir=/relative/path`: specifies a subdirectory for Puppy SFSs and a save file or folder.
* `waitdev=seconds`: specifies the timeout for search for Puppy SFSs and a save file or folder. If unspecified, the default is 5 seconds.
* `pfix=fsck`: enables file system error repair for save files.
* `pfix=fsckp`: enables file system error repair for mounted partitions.
* `pfix=rdsh`: drops to a rescue shell at the end of the early boot process.
* `pfix=nox`: disables automatic start of the graphical desktop.
* `loglevel=number`: specifies the verbosity level, using a printk log level: the default is 3 (KERN_ERR) and 7 (KERN_DEBUG) makes {/initrd,}/tmp/bootinit.log extra verbose.

## Configuration Files

### /etc/environment

This file defines environment variables for the user's interactive shell and all descendant processes, including the compositor.

Among other things, this file defines the dwl background and window border color.

### ~/.libinputrc

This file defines input device (mouse and touchpad) settings.

For example, to enable left-handed mode:

	LIBINPUT_DEFAULT_LEFT_HANDED=1

### ~/.xkbrc

This file defines keyboard settings.

For example, to enable English and Hebrew with Alt+Shift to switch between the two:

	XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=us,il
	XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=grp:alt_shift_toggle

### ~/.config/autostart/swayidle.desktop

This configures auto-start of swayidle, which turns off the screen after 600 seconds of inactivity.

You can disable swayidle by deleting this file, or change the interval via ~/.config/swayidle/config.

### ~/.config/autostart/swaybg.desktop

This configures auto-start of swaybg and defines the background color or image to display.

### /etc/init.d/trim

This script runs at boot time and implements periodic TRIM.

To disable it:

	chmod -x /etc/init.d/trim

### /etc/rc.d/rc.local

This script can be used to run extra initialization steps at the end of the boot process.

### /etc/eventmanager

This file determines whether or not to offer the user to save on shutdown, when using PUPMODE 13.

To disable the prompt and skip saving on shutdown:

	ASKTOSAVE=false

### ~/.dwlinitrc

This script runs as dwl's child process and handles application auto-start.

### /var/local/xwin_disable_xerrs_log_flag

Delete this file to enable logging of compositor errors to /tmp/xerrs.log.
