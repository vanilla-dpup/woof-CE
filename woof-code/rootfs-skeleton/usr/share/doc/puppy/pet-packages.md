# .pet Packages

DISTRO_NAME provides partial backward compatibility with old .pet packages, through petget. Many .pet packages are old and unmaintained: some even depend on [ROX-Filer](https://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/ROX-Filer), [JWM](http://joewing.net/projects/jwm/) or [X.Org](https://www.x.org/).

To install a .pet package, open it using the file manager.

By default, petget is a hidden application without a menu entry until a .pet package is installed. To remove a .pet package, start petget through the menu entry, select a package and click Remove.

petget does not install missing dependencies automatically and does not verify package compatibility prior to installation.

petget does not provide easy means for search, download and creation of .pet packages.
